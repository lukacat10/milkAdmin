# Current status
Currently, most versions seem to work, because the plugin was built around basic Bukkit API and no nms.

That doesn't mean that things won't break. 
# This thing is so old
This thing is so old, that it required jdk 1.5.
This thing is so old, that my entire intllij scrollbar was COMPLETELY yellow.
This thing is so old, that it still treated item id's as integers.

More fixes are on the way. Help would be appreciated.
